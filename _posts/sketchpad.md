# What is SketchPad
SketchPad is an amazing exstenstion in the chrome web store. You can draw things (bananas) and easily save them. If you close the exstentionn,

it still saves on the exstention, so when you re-open it you're back to your art! To get the exstention, use this link, https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sketchpad/eekbbmglbfldjpgbmajenafphnfjonnc.

After downloading it, you can draw pictures, save it, and send it to me using gmail! If you're luck, I will post it here!
